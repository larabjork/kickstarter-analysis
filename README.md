# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Project Background
Louise, an emerging artist and playwright, wants to launch a Kickstarter to support a new production of her play, _Fever_. The estimated budget for the play is $12,000. She requested an analysis of Kickstarter data to help her understand factors influencing the success of past Kickstarter campaigns. 

Because the data set that Louise obtained includes a wider variety of projects than she is interested in, she has asked for a focus on 
* theater projects and not in other types of projects
* plays and musicals as subcategories of theater projects
* projects in the United States and Great Britain
* successful and failed projects, with cancelled and ongoing/live projects as less interesting
* the effect of timing of the Kickstarter's launch affect success (i.e., what time of year is most successful, if any)
* comparisons of Kickstarter goals and actual pledges received
* five specific productions held in Edinburgh that were funded through Kickstarter: _Be Prepared_, Checkpoint 22_, _Cutting Off Kate Bush_, _Jestia and Raedon_, and _The Hitchhikers's Guide to the Family_.

The original data set and the results from the data analysis are presented in the accompanying Excel file. A summary of the analysis and conclusions drawn from it is presented below.

### Success Versus Failure
The first step in the analysis process was to provide color-coding based on the status of each campaign: 

* succcessful (green): the campaign goal was met or, in some cases, exceeded
* canceled (yellow): the campaign was ended by the organizer
* live (blue): the campaign was active at the time that the data was obtained
* failed (red): the campaign did not meet its stated goal by the campaign deadline.

This color-coding assists in scanning the data, but it does not help answer most of Louise's questions. Therefore more analyses were conducted.

### Outcomes for All Types of Theater Campaigns in the US
As shown in the chart below, more than half of the 912 theater campaigns in US were successful (58%). However, the next largest category (at 38%) represents failed campaigns. The remaining 3% of campaigns were either canceled (2%) or live at the time of data reporting (1%).

### Outcomes for Campaigns to Fund Plays in Great Britain in the United States
As shown in the chart below, Kickstarters to fund plays in both countries have largely been successful. Although fewer total campaigns have been launched in Great Britain (314 versus 671 in the United States), the success rate is greater in Great Britain (76% versus 61%).
